Python based app created on Ubuntu which notifies user to take a break after each hour.

Application notifies busy coders to take a break and take care of their eyes. Again it beeps after 10 minutes of breakto attract the lousy coder back to the workstation.

To use, just download and execute the main file - code.py.
 (Just go to the repo where code is present and execute code.py using python3 code.py)


In case you want to add it to your startup,
1. Go to Ubuntu Dash
2. Search and open "Startup Application"
3. Click on "Add"
4. Specify the name 
5. In command field, enter "python3 'path_where_the_code_is_saved'" For eg. I have entered - python3 "/home/anshuman/PycharmProjects/desktop_notifier/code.py"
6.Enter any comment you would like
